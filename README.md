Coding is more than just reading. The original code is the finnal chapter. I thought it might be good for beginners learning step by step. So I split all code according to chapters. What's more, using CMake to generate projects is convenient. 

All of the code in this repo are tested by myself. 

# Notes
I use `rand()` function to generate random numbers rather than `drand48()`.
