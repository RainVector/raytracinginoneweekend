Ray Tracing in One Weekend

![Ray Tracing in One Weekend](./RTOneWeekend.jpg)

Coding is better than just reading.
The original code is the finnal chapter. 
I thought it might be good for beginners learning step by step. 
So I split all code according to chapters. 
What's more, using CMake to generate projects is convenient. 

All of the code in this repo are tested by myself. 

# Notes
1. I use `rand()` function to generate random numbers rather than `drand48()`.
2. I found a great [Online PPM Image Viewer][1]
